                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, the biological world and tech world have interested me. As I grew older, I hit a fork in the road and I headed down the biology path.
                    Even though I went down this path, I've always kept up with the tech world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I graduated college, I started working in the biotech industry. After working a few years in the biotech industry, I started to wonder, "What if I had taken that other path? What if I headed down
                    tech/programming path?" After much pondering and research, I decided to turn around to take that path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am at <span><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com">Coding Dojo</a></span> learning how to code. I am running full speed down this new path and who knows. Maybe one day the bio path and the tech path can merge into a new one.
